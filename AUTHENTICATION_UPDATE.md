# Authentication System Update - May 2025

## Changes Made

As of May 2025, the NexPrep application has been updated to remove the phone OTP verification functionality to avoid incurring Firebase SMS verification costs. The following changes have been implemented:

1. **Removed Phone Authentication**:
   - Removed all phone OTP verification code and UI elements
   - Removed reCAPTCHA integration used for phone verification
   - Deleted phone testing documentation and utilities

2. **Enhanced Google Sign-In**:
   - Added additional scopes (profile, email)
   - Implemented forced account selection
   - Improved error handling
   - Fixed response handling to support different backend response formats

3. **Maintained Authentication Methods**:
   - Email/Password login
   - Google Sign-In

## Documentation Updates

Several documentation files have been added or updated:

1. `frontend/AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive guide to the authentication system
2. `frontend/FIREBASE_CONFIG_UPDATES.md` - Required Firebase Console configuration changes
3. `frontend/FIREBASE_OPTIMIZATION.md` - Best practices for Firebase configuration
4. `frontend/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` - Updated environment setup instructions

## Firebase Console Configuration

After pulling these changes, please ensure to:

1. **Disable Phone Authentication** in the Firebase Console to prevent any possibility of incurring SMS verification costs
2. Review other authentication settings as detailed in `FIREBASE_OPTIMIZATION.md`

## Testing

Both authentication methods have been tested and confirmed working:
- Email/Password login works correctly
- Google Sign-In works correctly

## Additional Notes

- No changes to the backend authentication API were necessary
- User data and existing sessions are not affected by these changes

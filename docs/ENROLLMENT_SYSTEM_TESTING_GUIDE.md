## ðŸš€ How to Test the System

### Step 1: Start Both Servers
```bash
# Backend (port 5000)
cd backend
npm run dev

# Frontend (port 4200) 
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Step 2: Add Sample Data
You need to add exam families, levels, and branches to test enrollment. Use the generated MongoDB script:

```bash
# From backend directory
node scripts/createSampleData.js
# This creates mongo-sample-data.js

# Then run the MongoDB script
mongo nexprep < mongo-sample-data.js
```

Or manually add data via MongoDB Compass/shell using the provided commands.

### Step 3: Test the Flow

#### **New User Experience:**
1. **Register** at http://localhost:4200/register
2. **Login** - automatically redirected to profile page
3. **See welcome message** - "Please make sure you are enrolled in at least one exam category"
4. **Find "My Enrollments" section** in profile page
5. **Click "Add New Enrollment"**
6. **Fill out enrollment form** with exam family, levels, branches
7. **Submit enrollment**
8. **Try accessing content** (home, tests, dashboard) - should work now!

#### **Existing User Experience:**
1. **Login** - redirected to profile page with welcome message
2. **If no enrollments** - see enrollment requirement
3. **If has enrollments** - can access all content normally

#### **Unenrolled User Protection:**
1. **Login without enrollments**
2. **Try to access** `/home`, `/tests`, `/student/dashboard`
3. **Get redirected** to profile page with enrollment message
4. **Must enroll** before accessing content

### Step 4: Test API Endpoints

```bash
# Get enrollment options (requires authentication)
GET http://localhost:5000/api/enrollments/enrollment-options

# Get my enrollments
GET http://localhost:5000/api/enrollments/my-enrollments

# Create enrollment
POST http://localhost:5000/api/enrollments/enroll
{
  "examFamily": "EXAM_FAMILY_ID",
  "examLevels": ["LEVEL_ID_1", "LEVEL_ID_2"],
  "branches": ["BRANCH_ID_1", "BRANCH_ID_2"],
  "accessLevel": "basic"
}
```
